# Prework Study Guide for Students and the World

## Description

This project will serve as a repository for basic coding know-how and serve as a helpful study guide for myself and any other beginning coding students.

Given the vast amount of information we are likely to cover in the coding bootcamp, which serves as the impetus for this project, a unified compendium of terminology and tips may prove invaluable.

Additionally, this study project has been and will continue to be a focal point of learning, as well as a sandbox of sorts with which to practice my burgeoning coding skills.
